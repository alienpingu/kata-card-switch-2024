## Kata Frontend: Switch Card

**Description:**
The Switch Card Kata aims to develop an intuitive frontend interface that allows users to toggle between two different subscription options: Basic and Premium. The goal is to implement an ON/OFF switch that enables users to select their desired subscription type. When the switch is set to "ON", the user will see the card related to the Premium subscription, while when it's set to "OFF", the card related to the Basic subscription will be displayed.

**Technical Requirements:**
1. Use HTML to structure the interface, including at least two cards: one for the Basic subscription and one for the Premium subscription.
2. Implement an ON/OFF switch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Use CSS for styling the cards and the switch, ensuring a clean and intuitive presentation.
4. Use JavaScript to handle the switch state change and dynamically modify the display of cards based on the switch state.
5. Ensure that the switch accurately reflects the current state, displaying the corresponding subscription card accordingly.

**Additional Tips:**
- Utilize CSS transitions or animations to make the interaction more fluid and enjoyable for users.
- Provide clear visual feedback to indicate the current switch state.
- Thoroughly test the user interface to ensure a seamless experience across different devices and browsers.

**Conclusion:**
In addition to the basic functionality of this kata, it's essential to ensure that the user experience is equally visually rewarding. Incorporating effective design principles, such as a harmonious choice of colors, clean arrangement of elements, and clear visual feedback, will help make the interface more appealing and satisfying for users. Attention to graphical details not only enhances the overall look of the kata but can also positively influence usability and user perception of the reliability and overall quality of the product. Therefore, while developing this interface, it's advisable to dedicate the necessary time to ensure that every aspect, both functional and aesthetic, is carefully crafted and seamlessly integrated.
